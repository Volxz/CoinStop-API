# CoinStop-API
#### A NodeJS based API to gather MPOS data

## WHY MAKE THIS?
Coinstop runs a VueJS based page and getting each pools api data was strenuous for both our servers and the client. We made this daemon to host all the mpos data and update every 10 seconds to avoid any kind of strain on our instances or the client.
